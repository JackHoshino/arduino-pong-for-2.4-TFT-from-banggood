# arduino-pong-for-2.4-TFT-from-banggood
the pong folder is the code for if you are using the touchscreen to control the pallets
the pong for arduino with shield folder is the code for the arduino with the shield for if you are using pushbuttonshbuttons, 
upload this to the arduino with the pushbuttons.
the arduino without shield folder is the code for if you are using pus
this is the first version of pong on the internet for the 2.4" TFTLCD available on <http://eu.banggood.com/Wholesale-Warehouse-2_4-Inch-TFT-LCD-Shield-Touch-Board-Display-Module-For-Arduino-UNO-wp-Uk-940735.html> using the adafruit gfx library, available on gihub here: <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library>, the TFTLCD library: &lt;https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library> and the arduino touchscreen library: <https://github.com/adafruit/Touch-Screen-Library> , this took me 8 days to make and im pretty proud of myself as it is the first application i made with the LCD. if you have any issues with setting this up, please report.

guide for if you are using pushbuttons:

i made a new version that works with 2 arduinos, just connect the serial pins 1and 0 and reverse them on the other arduino, wire the pushbuttons to
the right pins, add pulldown resistors, upload the right code for each arduino an dyou are good to go!
